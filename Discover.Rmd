# Biomarker Discovery

Differential cluster analysis and marker analysis amongst two conditions can be performed automatically with cytoMine. We use edgeR to perform such analysis. For more complicated comparisons(more than two conditions, batch effect correction or multiple time points), please contact our bioinformatician as these models are complicated and cannot be automated.

## Differential cluster analysis
For differential cluster analysis, clusters generated by FlowSOM or ClusterX or merged clusters are taken as input. Samples in two conditions are compared to see which clusters are differentially present in the two groups.

## Differential marker analysis
For differential marker analysis, we take median expression of each marker in a sample and then perform differential marker expression analysis on it to see which makers are different in the two conditions.
